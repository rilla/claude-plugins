# ⚠️ DISCLAIMER - EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT ⚠️

## This is an Experiment / Exploration / Test

This Claude Code plugin is **NOT production-ready** and should be considered:

- ✋ **Experimental** - Testing ideas and patterns
- 🧪 **Proof of Concept** - Demonstrating consolidated approaches
- 📝 **Work in Progress** - Subject to major changes
- 🚧 **Not Battle-Tested** - Has not been used in production Rails projects

## What This Is

An **exploration** of consolidating two excellent Rails development approaches:
1. Evil Martians' conventions (from palkan's AGENTS.md)
2. 37signals' One Person Framework philosophy

Created by consolidating patterns from existing open-source plugins and documentation.

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ **NOT officially endorsed** by Evil Martians or 37signals
- ❌ **NOT production-ready** - use at your own risk
- ❌ **NOT a replacement** for reading the original sources
- ❌ **NOT comprehensive** - may have gaps, errors, or conflicts

## Use at Your Own Risk

This plugin may:
- Generate code with unintended patterns
- Have internal inconsistencies
- Miss edge cases or important considerations
- Change significantly between versions

## Recommendations

1. **Read the original sources:**
   - [Evil Martians' AGENTS.md](https://gist.github.com/palkan/482010bd6ec434685f106779e863d0ef)
   - [37signals' One Person Framework](https://once.com/free-stuff/one-person-framework)
   - [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/)

2. **Review all generated code** before using in production

3. **Provide feedback** - if you find issues, please open an issue

4. **Contribute improvements** - PRs welcome to make this better

## Credits

This consolidates patterns from:
- Evil Martians (rails-codegen by @palkan)
- 37signals team (One Person Framework)
- Mario Alberto Chávez (rails-simplifier)
- Rails community

All credit goes to the original authors. Any mistakes are mine.

**TL;DR:** This is a test. Don't use in production without careful review. Read the originals. Feedback welcome.
